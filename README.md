# COBOL Projects Repository

This repository aggregates various COBOL projects to demonstrate proficiency in COBOL programming.

## Requirements

To run COBOL programs, you need a COBOL compiler. For Linux users, you can install GnuCOBOL with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install gnucobol
```

## Compiling COBOL Programs
To compile a COBOL program (.cbl) into an executable, use the following command:

```cobc -x -o nameOfExecutable NAME_OF_COBOL_PROGRAM.cbl
```

## Running the Executable
Once compiled, you can execute the resulting program using the standard Linux command:

```./nameOfExecutable
```
